# Communication

Our team is physically distributed and highly collaborative. The following channels and norms support our collaboration.

## Communication within our team

* **[Slack](https://pulibrary.slack.com/)** for general chat and discussion, sharing news, asking for feedback/code review, receiving issue reports
  * Frequently-used docs, boards, zoom rooms, and chats are in the bookmarks bar of our team channel
  * It's good to be generally available on Slack, but it's fine to mute/ignore/turn off as needed
* **Zoom** for meetings, team co-working, and social chats
  * If you use outlook, thereâ€™s a zoom plugin for outlook which will allow you to add a zoom meeting during scheduling
  * DLS meetings tend to start at the advertised start time and not go past the end time
  * DLS has a cameras-on culture in general, with the understanding that folks also need time with cameras off
* **[Github](https://github.com/pulibrary)** and **[Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dls-work-cycle-613924a1df719e0013b678b0/board)** for issues, code, pull requests, code review, and cycle planning.
  * Ensure you receive github notifications, especially mentions
* **[Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox)/Exchange** calendars for internal meetings
  * Please share your calendar with the rest of the team to make it easier to book meetings
* **Google Docs** for meeting notes, drafting docs, spreadsheets
* **Face-to-face** meetings
  * IT All Hands is one week per year in June at Princeton
  * DLS has an in-person retreat on campus once a year in the winter or spring

## Communication with other teams

* **Email** for getting input from outside IT, or for longer-form feedback
  * Our group email address: digital-library@princeton.libanswers.com
  * When issues come in for us from libanswers, everyone will get alerted. The first person to respond should click through to the issue and either deal with it, create an issue for it, or assign it to the appropriate person.
  * Note that clicking through to a ticket will automatically assign it to you. You can click the "unassign" button if needed. If you just want to browse tickets, you can use the eye icon on the list in the UI to "quick look," which won't assign it to you.
* **SN@P / lsupport**
  * Create an issue for helpdesk or operations by emailing lsupport@princeton.edu
* **[Digital Collections and Initiatives](https://library.princeton.edu/digital-collections/news)** page of the library Website
