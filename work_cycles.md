# Work Cycles

## Development Rhythm

Our team works in a 3 week rhythm. Work cycles are two-weeks long, and every third
week is a maintenance/research week.

The following table represents our cycle-related meeting schedule. Each meeting
will be described below.

|                        | Monday         | Tuesday        | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday  |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------        | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| Research & Maintenance | Wrap-up        | Cycle Planning | Standup   | Standup  | Standup |
| Work Cycle (Week 1)    | Standup        | Standup        | Standup   | Standup  | Standup |
| Work Cycle (Week 2)    | Standup        | Standup        | Standup   | Standup  | Standup |

## Meetings

### Work Cycle Planning

Occurs Tuesday at 3:00 PM eastern of Research & Maintenance week. Participants are
members of DLS and the product owner for the upcoming project.

#### Goals

1. Review the [Work Cycle Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dls-work-cycle-613924a1df719e0013b678b0/board?repos=98223070)
    and determine the tickets which will be undertaken in the
    next two weeks. Give them the 'work-cycle' label.
1. If this is a feature sprint, PO will identify one ticket which is a
   meaningful enhancement to an existing feature for users. Give it the
   work-cycle label.
1. Determine if there's any research to be done to validate that the work can
   happen in the following two weeks.

### Standup

Occurs daily at 4:00 PM Eastern when there isn't also a Cycle Planning or
Wrap-up meeting. Participants are members of DLS.

#### Goals

1. Determine if anyone's work is blocked.
1. Connect with the team.
1. Find pairing opportunities for the next work day.
1. If it's a friday, determine a runner for the following week.


### Work Cycle Wrap-up

Occurs Monday following the last week of the work cycle at 3:00 PM. Participants are
members of DLS and the product owner for the current project.

We moved this meeting from Friday to make it easier for team members to take off
Fridays for vacation.

#### Goals

1. Determine if the work cycle was a success or if another cycle needs to
   happen.
1. Share a demo if necessary, but the assumption is that product owners have
   been testing features as they've been implemented.
1. Review the [Maintenance & Research board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dls-maintenance--research-6139264d4f68940016d4b7cf/board?repos=26446857,98223070,49439415,157741631,251438007)
   * Look at the inbox to ensure any newly created maintenance tickets from
   running or reports are well understood.
   * Ensure everyone has tasks they can work on in the following week. New maintenance or research tickets should be assigned the "maintenance / research" label so they appear on our maintenance board.

## Retrospectives

DLS holds regular retrospectives to reflect on our accomplishments and
challenges, and to discuss any changes we may want to make to team process.
Retrospectives are scheduled every 6-8 weeks.
