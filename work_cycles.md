# Work Cycles

## Development Rhythm

Our team works in a 3 week rhythm. Work cycles are two-weeks long, and every third
week is a maintenance/research week.

The following table represents our cycle-related meeting schedule. Each meeting
will be described below.

|                        | Monday         | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday  |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| Research & Maintenance | Cycle Planning | Standup | Standup   | Standup  | Standup |
| Work Cycle (Week 1)    | Standup        | Standup | Standup   | Standup  | Standup |
| Work Cycle (Week 2)    | Standup        | Standup | Standup   | Standup  | Wrap-up |

## Meetings

### Work Cycle Planning

Occurs Monday at 3:00 PM eastern of Research & Maintenance week. Participants are
members of DLS and the product owner for the upcoming project.

#### Goals

1. Review the [Work Cycle Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dls-work-cycle-613924a1df719e0013b678b0/board?repos=98223070)
    and determine the tickets which will be undertaken in the
    next two weeks. Give them the 'work-cycle' label.
1. If this is a feature sprint, PO will identify one ticket which is a
   meaningful enhancement to an existing feature for users. Give it the
   work-cycle label.
1. Determine if there's any research to be done to validate that the work can
   happen in the following two weeks.

### Standup

Occurs daily at 3:30 PM Eastern when there isn't also a Cycle Planning or
Wrap-up meeting. Participants are members of DLS.

#### Goals

1. Determine if anyone's work is blocked.
1. Connect with the team.
1. Find pairing opportunities for the next work day.
1. If it's a friday, determine a runner for the following week.


### Work Cycle Wrap-up

Occurs Friday of the last week of the work cycle at 3:00 PM. Participants are
members of DLS and the product owner for the current project.

#### Goals

1. Determine if the work cycle was a success or if another cycle needs to
   happen.
1. Share a demo if necessary, but the assumption is that product owners have
   been testing features as they've been implemented.
1. Review the [Maintenance & Research board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dls-maintenance--research-6139264d4f68940016d4b7cf/board?repos=26446857,98223070,49439415,157741631,251438007)
   * Look at the inbox to ensure any newly created maintenance tickets from
   running or reports are well understood.
   * Ensure everyone has tasks they can work on in the following week. New maintenance or research tickets should be assigned the "maintenance / research" label so they appear on our maintenance board.
