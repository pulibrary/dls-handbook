# Digital Library Services Handbook

Welcome! The goal of this handbook is to provide insight into how the Digital
Library Services (DLS) team at
Princeton University Library (PUL) performs our work, the promises we make to our collaborators,
and the expectations we have of them. We also use this as a place to
document common practices and tools we've found useful in our team.

For documented cultural norms and technical practice across teams in PUL IT, see [pul-it-handbook](https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-it-handbook).

## Our Vision

DLS has worked with its partners to define a vision for the Digital Library in
the context of Princeton University Library's [Mission, Vision, and North Star
Statements](https://library.princeton.edu/about) that will help us situate
our work within the broader vision and move it forward.

> Princeton University's Digital Library will become an inspiring environment for global communities to engage with diverse collections. To support this goal, our Digital Library platform will enable easy ingest, long-term preservation, joyful discovery, and transformative use of digital materials.

DLS will prioritize development work and organization processes in such a way as to have the most impact towards this vision, and we encourage our partners and stakeholders to imagine ways for us to get there together.
