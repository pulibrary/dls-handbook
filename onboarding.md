# Onboarding

DLS strives to be welcoming and inclusive in our onboarding process for new team members. The initial tasks for any new team member will include:

- Becoming familiar with our team and department handbooks and Library goals
- Setting up hardware, including a development environment and password management
- Creating accounts across a variety of services
- Work through training curriculum, if relevant, and pair with DLS colleagues

New team members will be supported in these tasks by a DLS buddy assigned on a weekly basis. The buddy's first priority is to ensure the new team member is not blocked on any of their onboarding or other work, to answer the new team member's questions, and to pair with the new team member as needed.
