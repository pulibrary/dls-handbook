# Onboarding

DLS strives to be welcoming and inclusive in our onboarding process for new team members. The initial tasks for any new team member will include:

- Becoming familiar with this team handbook, [the departmental handbook](https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-it-handbook/), and [Library mission](https://library.princeton.edu/about)
- Setting up hardware, including a development environment and password manager
- Creating accounts across a variety of services
- Working through a training curriculum, if relevant
- Pairing with DLS colleagues

New team members will be supported in these tasks by a DLS buddy assigned on a weekly basis. The buddy's first priority is to ensure the new team member is not blocked on any of their onboarding or other work, to answer the new team member's questions, and to pair with the new team member as needed.
