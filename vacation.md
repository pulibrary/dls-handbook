# Vacation

DLS and the library as a whole recognizes the importance of time away from work
to refresh and maintain a healthy work/life balance. It's encouraged to take the
time you've accrued, and if at any point you feel you're unable to do so we will
work as a team to improve our process to enable it.

## What expectations are there of me while I'm on vacation?

You are expected to be on vacation. Our team has no expectations that you'll
answer email, respond to slack, read messages, or otherwise interact with work
while on vacation. We believe your time away improves your time in - please take
it and make the most out of it you can.

## Vacation Policy Resources

Princeton's vacation policies are documented here: [Vacation
Policy](https://hr.princeton.edu/myhr/policies/vacation). You will have to log
in with CAS.

If you are looking into joining our team and want details on the vacation policy
please feel free to contact any of us or the search committee you're engaged
with and they'd be happy to share the information above.

## Requesting Vacation Time

1. Send a message to your manager in Slack. Assuming no problems, do the
   following:
1. Update personal calendar with vacation time.
1. Your manager will update IT Away calendar (a shared calendar showing all of ITIMS' time away)
1. Put your vacation request into [self service](http://www.princeton.edu/hr/progserv/sds/applications/selfservice.html). This can be done when you get back, but must be done to keep accurate track of remaining vacation balance.
