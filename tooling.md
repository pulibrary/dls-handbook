# Development Tooling

In addition to this handbook page, we also have a document [How-to for core and
common
tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PRgujNUnLNklfXjWeQ4TeyxG3sULDCVfKR1x29HH9j0/edit#) which we encourage team members to add to.

## Standard DLS development tools
Make sure these are installed for your individual setup. Many / most of these are also used on other PUL IT teams

* [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for package management on macs
  * When projects have required dependencies, homebrew install instructions are provided in the readme
* [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) for language version management
  * All DLS projects include the `.tool-versions` configuration files for asdf
* [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for development dependencies
  * DLS projects are set up using lando (see below). Lando releases work best with certain versions of docker so the recommended way to install docker is to install lando, which will bring in the correct version of docker as part of its install process.
* git for version control
  * You'll also need a [Github](https://github.com/pulibrary) account
* [Lastpass](https://informationsecurity.princeton.edu/LastPass) for shared passwords

## Standard project tooling

The tools we use to configure, support, and monitor our applications

* Use [dls-github-labeler](https://github.com/pulibrary/dls-github-labeler) to generate an initial set of labels
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pulibrary) for CI
* [Bixby](https://github.com/samvera-labs/bixby) ruby style enforcement that wraps [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) and provides defaults determined by the Samvera open source community
* [Lando](https://lando.dev/) for running service dependencies like solr and postgres
* [HoneyBadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/), [DataDog](https://app.datadoghq.com/), and [Sensu](https://lib-monitor.princeton.edu/dashboard) for error tracking and monitoring
* [VPN](https://princeton.service-now.com/snap?sys_id=6023&id=kb_article) for connecting to our staging applications
* [SignalSciences](https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/) for analyzing incoming web traffic and identifying/blocking attacks
* tmux is on all our servers to allow us to run long tasks without risking
  connection loss. Several of us use it locally with vim.

## Individual Tools

* __Editors__: Use what you're comfortable with. VSCode is a good choice. Several members of DLS use vim. Many other editors are used on various development teams.
* __Wireframing and Diagraming__
  * We have institutional access to Adobe XD and Lucid Charts
  * websequencediagrams.com lets you code your diagram with text and then export
    it as an image
  * Try [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/tutorials.html) for markdown-based diagrams that will live on github.
* For __Browser testing__ we have a few licenses for BrowserStack.
* __Other tools__ used by members of our team include
  * [thoughtbot's laptop script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) for laptop setup
  * [thoughtbot's dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)
    * which uses [rcm dotfiles management](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)
  * zsh and [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
  * [github command line interface](https://github.com/cli/cli)

We frequently share new tooling discoveries and tips between teams at our all-hands
meetings and on our #devs slack channel.
