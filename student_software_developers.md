# Student Software and UX Developers

## Program

Our goal in this program is to fully integrate undergraduate developers into our team. These developers will be paired with members of DLS to initially build skills and then work issues to advance our software.

## Team Integration

Student Developers will operate as a member of the DLS team, with the exception
that their mentor acts as their direct supervisor. This means they will have a
buddy from DLS as part of their onboarding, and will pair with various members
of the team and have a weekly check-in with their mentor.

During the summer students will attend all DLS team meetings and participate on
the team slack channel. These communication outlets will allow for us to arrange
pairing sessions as needed.

During the school year students should continue to use the team slack channel to
collaborate with DLS team members. If a student's work schedule allows them to
attend the team stand-up they should do so. If not they should post a stand-up
style check in to the team slack channel, and ask for a pair if needed. Students
and mentors should continue to have a weekly 1:1 meeting.

### Absence from Work

If a student will miss their shift for any reason, they should post a message in the team slack channel saying that they won't be in. This ensures the team knows not to expect them in meetings, etc, even if their supervisor is also out. The student should follow up individually with their supervisor as to whether they will be using sick time or unpaid time.

## Policies
There is a library-wide [Student Employee Policy](https://pulstaff.princeton.edu/working-pul/library-student-employee-policy/), which covers accrued sick time, on the Connecting staff Intranet site. Note that the policies regarding shift replacements for absence are not relevant to these positions.

The pul-it-handbook has a page of [Policies specific to the Student Developers program](https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-it-handbook/blob/main/student-software-developers/requirements-and-policies.md), including work schedule expectations.

## Hiring and Onboarding
Hiring and mentorship documentation is maintained in the [Student Software Developers Administration Handbook](https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-it-handbook/blob/main/student-software-developers/administration-handbook.md) in the pul-it-handbook repository.

Day 1 onboarding documentation is maintained in the [Student Software Developers Student Handbook](https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-it-handbook/blob/main/student-software-developers/student-handbook.md)

Otherwise, onboarding for students will follow the same process as [onboarding](/onboarding.md) for other team members.

## Schedule Calendar

Student Software Developer schedules are tracked in a shared calendar called
"DLS Student Developers". DLS staff should request access to view and manage
this calendar from the manager of DLS. The account and password for this
exchange account is in LastPass under `Shared-ITIMS-Passwords/DLS/DLSStudentDevs
email`, but 2FA is set up for use by the current manager of DLS.

## Timesheets

Student Software Developers are paid biweekly. Timesheet and pay schedules are available on the [Payroll Cycles website](https://finance.princeton.edu/payroll-labor-accounting/payroll/payroll-basics/monthly-and-biweekly-payroll-cycles)
