# Administrative Resources

## Leave (vacation / personal / sick time)
* We expect regular hours, but we also know that life happens
* For appointments and interruptions, just let people know on Slack
* For vacation, request from supervisor. For personal and sick time, just notify.
  * Email supervisor to confirm days/times and create a record.
* Put it on your own Outlook calendar
* Enter it in [self service](http://www.princeton.edu/hr/progserv/sds/applications/selfservice.html)
* Mention to colleagues the day before or as needed just so they don't wonder where you are.
  * There is a calendar called it-away that shows vacation time for everyone in
    it, maintained at the manager level. It can be useful if you're wondering
    about other people's vacation schedules.

## Travel
* Travel for conferences and professional development is encouraged (within reason), both within the library community, and in the broader IT/tech world
* [Travel Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WORBC6qN5xBnf3kLjRg1saZ8ry0Y0_q43DfRtVG737w/edit?ts=59c00233#gid=1091990914) for tracking who's going to which events (there are tabs for different years)
* Request funding using the [Travel and Leave Requests](http://approvals.princeton.edu/) app
  * Include the [GSA per diem rates](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/) (M&IE/meals and incidentals) for the city you're traveling to
* [Concur](https://princeton.edu/concur) for booking travel and submitting expense reports
  * Can also use third-party sites to book travel if that makes sense, but it'll take more data entry to put in your expense report
* [Princeton’s travel site](http://travel.princeton.edu/)
* [[https://clubquartershotels.com/]] for discounted rooms in some cities
