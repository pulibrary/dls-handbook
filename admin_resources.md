# Administrative Resources

## Leave (vacation / personal / sick time)
* We expect regular hours, but we also know that life happens
* For appointments and interruptions, just let people know on Slack
* For vacation, please review the handbook page on [Vacation](vacation.md)
* Put it on your own Outlook calendar
* Enter it in [self service](http://www.princeton.edu/hr/progserv/sds/applications/selfservice.html)
* Mention to colleagues the day before or as needed just so they don't wonder where you are.
  * There is a calendar called it-away that shows vacation time for everyone in
    it, maintained at the manager level. It can be useful if you're wondering
    about other people's vacation schedules.
