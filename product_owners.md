# Product Owners

We strive for each of our applications to have a product owner (PO). The product
owner is usually a key stakeholder for the application who can collaborate
closely with us to guide development. Documentation of our team's [work cycles](/work_cycles.md) and [technical liaison role](/technical_liaisons.md) should give product owners useful context for this collaboration.

The exact practices of each product owner will vary according to the application and the
individuals themselves. Generally, product owners will work to:

* Communicate with other stakeholders and users as-needed, either ad-hoc as a committee.
* Participate during relevant work cycles by attending the planning meeting and
  Friday wrap-up meeting when the PO's application is a focus of the cycle.
* Work with the technical liaison to prioritize and specify issues. Having a GitHub account will enable the PO to be most fully integrated into this process.
* Be available on slack during a relevant work cycle to answer questions and
  give feedback.

DLS will work to:

* Provide appropriate notice to a PO when a relevant work cycle is upcoming, at least 1 week before it begins, and earlier if possible.
  * If the previous work cycle needs to continue to meet our goals, DLS will
    notify the PO of the delay and adjust the meeting invitations appropriately.
* Ensure planning and wrap-up meeting agendas provide times during which POs can
  expect topics to be focused on their project.
* Triage incoming tickets and bug reports.
* Remain easy to contact on Slack to assist with troubleshooting.

Resources for each application, including technical liaisons and links to repositories and zenhub boards, can be found on the [list of applications](/applications.md).
