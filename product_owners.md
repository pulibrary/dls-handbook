# Product Owners

We strive for each of our applications to have a product owner (PO). The product
owner is usually a key stakeholder for the application who can collaborate
closely with us to guide development. Documentation of our team's [work cycles](/work_cycles.md) and [technical liaison role](/technical_liaisons.md) should give product owners useful context for this collaboration.

The exact practices of each product owner will vary according to the application and the
individuals themselves. Generally, product owners will work to:

* Maintain a list of the highest priority issues for stakeholders on an ongoing
basis.
  * We recommend keeping track of these either in Github using a list of 10
  "On Deck" labeled issues or using Zenhub to organize these to the top of the
  project board's "Ready" column.
  * The Technical Liaison for your project is available to support the PO in this
  effort.
* Participate during relevant work cycles by attending the planning meeting and
  Friday wrap-up meeting when the PO's application is a focus of the cycle.
* Remain easy to contact on Slack during a relevant work cycle to answer
  questions and give feedback.
  give feedback.
* Bring in DLS developers when discussing new features or potential changes to the
  existing system with stakeholders. Prioritize these conversations when a work
  cycle that can address these is likely to happen soon.

DLS will work to:

* Provide appropriate notice to a PO when a relevant work cycle is upcoming, at
least 1 week before the relevant Cycle Planning meeting (see [work cycles](/work_cycles.md).)
  * If the previous work cycle needs to continue to meet our goals, DLS will
    notify the PO of the delay and adjust the meeting invitations appropriately.
* Ensure planning and wrap-up meeting agendas provide times during which POs can
  expect topics to be focused on their project.
* Triage incoming tickets and bug reports.
* Remain easy to contact on Slack to assist with troubleshooting.

Resources for each application, including technical liaisons and links to repositories and zenhub boards, can be found on the [list of applications](/applications.md).
